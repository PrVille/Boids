-Created project-
As instructed by email from assistant I'm writing this progress log to indicate I haven't started the project yet and will be doing so soon.

30.03.22
-Classes added-
Main - GUI
Ticker - Animate
Boid - Single boid with a draw method
Flock - Collection of boids
Simulation - Controls the simulation
Behaviour - controls the behaviour of a flock

All the methods in the project work correctly so far.
I have difficulty understanding creating the GUI how I want it to look like.
Workload spent on the project has been small ~10h and I am lagging behind due to other courses.
There will be more time next week and I will be focusing on the project then.

13.04.22
-Classes added-
Obstacle - single obstacle
Predator - single predator

Behaviour trait class contains rules for boids and predators to operate on:
  Applying edges for boids and predators, bouncing from walls or wrapping around
  Applying speed limits for boids and predators
  Boids flocking behaviour - separation, alignment and cohesion
  Boids also have rules to avoid predators and objects
  Predators have rule to seek the nearest prey

Main class controls gui

Simulation controls the simulation and has multiple key methods:
  Updating the boids and predator position guided by behaviour
  Drawing boids, obstacle, predator
  Resetting flock
  Adding and removing boids, predators, obstacles
  Toggling different settings like turbomode, racism, autospawn

Flock class includes methods for adding and removing boids in a flock and creating new boids

All the requirements for the project are met and work correctly. I have added extras like predators and objects and methods relating to them.
Workload spent on the project so far is around 40h. I have some more ideas to add and cleaning up the code.
